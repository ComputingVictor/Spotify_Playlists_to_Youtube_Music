```

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Spotify Developer Account
- Google Cloud Project with YouTube Data API enabled

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development installation

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

### 1. Spotify API Setup

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Obtain your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Add `http://localhost:8888/callback` as a **Redirect URI** in the app settings
5. Save these credentials for later use

### 2. YouTube Music API Setup

As of November 2024, YouTube Music requires OAuth authentication using the YouTube Data API:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**
4. Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**:
   - Select "External" user type
   - Fill in the required app information
   - **IMPORTANT**: Add your YouTube Music account email as a test user
   - You'll need to add any Google account that will use this tool as a test user
5. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**:
   - Click "Create Credentials"
   - Select **OAuth client ID**
   - Choose **TVs and Limited Input devices**
   - Download the credentials file (optional, but good to have)

6. Run the OAuth setup utility:
   ```bash
   ytmusicapi oauth
   ```

7. Follow the instructions:
   - A URL and code will be displayed
   - Open the URL in your browser
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Enter the displayed code
   - Confirm the requested permissions

8. This will create an `oauth.json` file in the current directory with this format:
   ```json
   {
    "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "access_token": "ya29.a0AZYkNZiK...",
    "refresh_token": "1//03OJYQHLNGghG...",
    "expires_at": 1744620393,
    "expires_in": 3599
   }
   ```

### 3. Environment File (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in the project root to store your Spotify credentials:

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
```

## Usage

1. Make sure the `oauth.json` file is in the same directory as the script

2. Run the migrator:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. If you haven't set up the `.env` file, you'll be prompted to enter your Spotify credentials

4. The script will:
   - Connect to both Spotify and YouTube Music
   - List all your Spotify playlists
   - Ask which ones you want to migrate

5. Enter playlist numbers separated by commas (e.g., "1,3,5") or "all" to migrate everything

6. The migration process will begin:
   - Each playlist will be created on YouTube Music
   - Each song will be searched on YouTube Music
   - Matching songs will be added to the new playlist
   - A summary will be displayed at the end

## Advanced Features

### Token Refreshing

OAuth tokens expire after approximately 1 hour (3599 seconds as specified in the `expires_in` field). If you get authentication errors:

1. Run `ytmusicapi oauth` again to generate a new token
2. Replace the existing `oauth.json` file
3. Delete the `ytmusic_headers.json` file if it exists
4. Run the script again

### Playlist Privacy

By default, all migrated playlists are set to PRIVATE. You can modify this in the code if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Spotify Authentication Issues

- Verify your Client ID and Client Secret
- Ensure your Redirect URI is configured correctly in the Spotify Developer Dashboard
- Check if your `.env` file has the correct format

### YouTube Music Authentication Errors

- "invalid_grant" error: Your OAuth token has expired. Generate a new one with `ytmusicapi oauth`
- Permission errors: Make sure your email is added as a test user in the OAuth consent screen
- If you receive a 401 or 403 error, check that:
  - The YouTube Data API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
  - Your OAuth consent screen is properly configured

### Migration Errors

- Rate limiting: If you get API rate limit errors, the script will pause, but you might need to wait longer
- Songs not found: Some songs may not be available on YouTube Music or might have different titles
- Long playlists: YouTube Music has a limit of 5,000 songs per playlist

## Performance and Limitations

### API Rate Limits
- **Spotify API**: Generally allows up to 100 requests per second
- **YouTube Music API**: Has more restrictive rate limits (approximately 1-2 requests per second recommended)
- The tool includes automatic delays (0.5s between requests) to respect rate limits

### Known Limitations
- YouTube Music playlists are limited to 5,000 songs maximum
- Some songs may not be available on YouTube Music due to licensing
- Song matching is based on title and artist name, which may not always be accurate
- OAuth tokens expire after 1 hour and need to be refreshed

### Performance Tips
- For large playlists (>500 songs), expect migration to take 5-10 minutes per playlist
- Close other applications using YouTube Music API during migration
- If you encounter rate limit errors, wait a few minutes before retrying

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `invalid_grant` | OAuth token expired | Run `ytmusicapi oauth` again |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid credentials | Check Spotify Client ID/Secret |
| `403 Forbidden` | YouTube API not enabled | Enable YouTube Data API in Google Cloud Console |
| `Rate limit exceeded` | Too many API requests | Wait 5-10 minutes and try again |
| `Playlist creation failed` | YouTube Music API error | Check if you're signed into the correct Google account |

### Debugging Mode

To enable verbose logging, set the environment variable:
```bash
export SPOTIFY_YTMUSIC_DEBUG=1
python src/main.py
```

## Security Considerations

- **Never share your `oauth.json` file** - it contains your Google account tokens
- **Keep your `.env` file private** - it contains your Spotify credentials
- The tool only requests read access to Spotify and write access to YouTube Music
- All playlist creation is done with PRIVATE visibility by default
- No personal data is stored beyond the current session
